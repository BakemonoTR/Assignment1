        Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind
</h2>

    <p>This book explores the history of the human species, Homo sapiens, from the Stone Age to the modern Silicon Valley era. Harari divides human history into major revolutions: the Cognitive Revolution (the ability to imagine and communicate complex ideas), the Agricultural Revolution, and the Scientific Revolution. He argues that what makes humans unique is our ability to create and believe in shared fictions—such as money, nations, and religions—which allow us to cooperate in large numbers and dominate the planet.</p>

        The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
</h2>

<p>This hilarious book begins with Arthur Dent, an ordinary Englishman, being rescued by his friend Ford Prefect just seconds before the Earth is demolished to make way for a galactic hyperspace bypass. Together, they hitch a ride on a spaceship and travel through the universe. With the help of the guidebook "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"—which famously advises "Don't Panic"—they encounter eccentric characters, depressed robots, and absurd situations.
