# Assignment 1 - Web Development Project

This repository contains the source code for **Assignment 1**, developed for the CMP309 Web Programming course. Below is a brief overview of the project's theme, file structure, and the challenges faced during development.

## 🎨 Theme

The main theme of this website is **Book Blog**.

## File Organization

* **`index.cshtml`**: The home page of the website. It currently features a curated list of **"This Week's Popular Books"**.
* **`about.cshtml`**: A descriptive page that introduces the website, its mission, and the team behind it.
* **`services.cshtml`**: This page lists the various services offered by the blog along with their **prices**
* **`contact.cshtml`**: Includes a **contact form** for users to send messages or inquiries directly to the administration.
* **`assets/`**: A centralized folder containing all media files, including book covers, icons.


During the development of this assignment, the main technical challenge encountered was:

1.  **Sticky Footer Alignment:** I faced a significant issue with **pinning the footer to the bottom** of the viewport on pages with little content. It was difficult to ensure the footer stayed at the very bottom regardless of the page height. I researched CSS Flexbox and `min-height` techniques to attempt to resolve this.But it is not solved.
